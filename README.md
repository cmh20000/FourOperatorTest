# FourOperatorTest


In this project, I try to build a generator of four operatorr and have realized these functions:

1. support bracket
2. make a GUI


In the src folder, there are source code, and the Four.h and Four.cpp is the core of my arithmetic. Pay attention to that if you want to load the whole project, you may need to install Qt5.4

In the output folder, there is the exe generated by the code. You can run the Four.exe to test the function. Pay attention that you may fail to run it if there is no VS in your computer.
